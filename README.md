### Rationale

There are a number of books on applied data analysis, or data science. A prominent example is [Wickham and Grolemund's (2017) R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1484001738&sr=8-1&keywords=r+for+data+science). This does not attempt to supplement or improve on this and other excellent books on data science, but rather to approach the topic from the perspective of educational researchers carrying out research.

Consequently, this focuses in on the needs of educational researchers in three ways:

* Demonstrating approaches the most widespread data analytic problems.
* Adapting to the background knowledge and training of educational researchers.
* Utilizing examples from or relevant to educational research.
